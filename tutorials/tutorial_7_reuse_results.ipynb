Be aware that the loaded data and models will not be copied to the result folder created for your current run in most cases. Thus, if deleting any folder from `results`, make sure that no other run relies on data contained in the folder you want to delete.  \n",

The image below shows an example structure for simulating, training and diagnosing a full DDM while setting `result_folder: full_ddm`. Afterwards, the evaluate step is performed thrice on different experimental datasets while setting `result_folder: full_ddm/experimental_data_x`.\n",

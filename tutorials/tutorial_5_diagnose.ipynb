The posterior can be assumed to be well calibrated, if the prior sample $\\tilde{\\theta}_i$ that generated the test observations $\\tilde{x}_i$ is uniformly distributed within the coverage of the posterior samples $\\{\\theta_1, ..., \\theta_L\\}_i$. To verify this uniform distribution, the rank of each $\\tilde{\\theta}_i$ is computed, i.e. the number of posterior samples $\\{\\theta_1, ..., \\theta_L\\}_i$ that are smaller than $\\tilde{\\theta}_i$.

In the example plot below a slight positive bias pattern for the drift parameter is identifiable. The drift bias is in accordance with the small global p-value that has been computed for the drift parameter.
